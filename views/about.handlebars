				I am a junior full stack web developer with a background in
				foodindustry and automotive service.
				I began my professional career with an apprenticeship as a
				brewer, where I subsequently also completed my master's degree
				at the Technical University of Berlin.<br />
				After that I worked for the ARWE Group, until then europe's
				largest company in automotive service, as team leader and later
				on as quality manager.<br />
				When the group went bankrupt during the Corona crisis, I was now
				able to consistently realise my long-held wish for a
				reorientation. To realise my long-cherished wish I had already
				gained my first experience of coding at CodeCademy.com and was
				sure that coding would be my future. <br />When I was offered
				the chance to attend a bootcamp at Spiced Academy to become a
				full stack web developer, I took it.<br />
				In this intensive 12 week course I dived into the depths of
				JavaScript. At Spiced Academy I built my first full stack web
				applications using third party APIs, frontend frameworks like
				React.js and Vue.js and backend like Express. So please have a
				look at some of my code on
